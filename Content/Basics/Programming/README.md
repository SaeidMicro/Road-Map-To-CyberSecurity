## Programming

There are two opinions about learning programming.

#### The first opinion: 
* Programming is an indispensable thing and helps you gain a deep understanding of cybersecurity. The more you become distinguished in programming, the more distinguished you will become in cybersecurity.
#### Second opinion: 
* You can just limit yourself to the basics in just one programming language, or even not learn programming.

## My opinion
I agree with the first opinion and I think that you should learn at least one programming language such as PHP or scripting language such as Python.
